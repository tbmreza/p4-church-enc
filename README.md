At least up until the middle of doing this I find several "provided conversions" unproductive
to use as they are coded in the starter code. I sort of move the goalpost by rolling my own
unchurcify functions for the following cases:
- bool0
- bool1

I understand that they are there partially to steer the definitions that I use. But simply
some of them are hardly penetrable to work out as source code. I don't think that's ideal;
I'll come back here maybe with higher programming mileage and a fresh perspective.
